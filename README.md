# Open Design Agency
Right now the Open Design Agency (ODA) is an idea. The idea being that the fundamental concepts behind the free and open source software movement can be applied to the design industry and that a design organisation working in this way would be of greater benefit to those who create design work and those who consume it than the incumbent model of closed-door agencies and internal design studios.

## Contributing
The Open Design Agency needs your support. It's early days and we need all the help we can get. Our needs will of course change over time as our organisation grows and matures, but here are some thoughts on how you could help:
* Criticise this document ([raise an issue](https://github.com/opendesignagency/oda/issues)).
* Improve this document with your own insight and ideas (either [raise an issue](https://github.com/opendesignagency/oda/issues), or fork this repo and issue a pull request with your changes).
* Share a this document with friends and colleagues.
* Invite us to talk about the ODA at your conference, event or within your organisation.
* Sign up as a contributor, essentially offering to become a member of the our community and participate in our work in whatever capacity you can. I.e., as an organiser, designer (graphic/UX/Service/etc.), developer, reviewer, lawyer, accountant, marketer, advisor, sysadmin, etc.
* Sign up as a client, tell us what kind of work you would like us to undertake with your organisation.
* Offer the use of physical space for our work.
* If you run or work at a design agency, either allow your staff to contribute their time to our effors or encourage your managers to let you do so.
* Donate intellectual property by releasing it under an appropriate license.
* Donate money to fund our efforts (when we figure out how to legally do this, you could help with figuring this out too).

## Goals
* Bring design work out from behind the closed-doors of design studios and into the open. With total transparency and availability of information to those doing the work and those paying for the work to be done.
* Lower the barrier to entry for people who wish to do design work or otherwise contribute to design initiatives. No requirements on qualifications or experience. A meritocracy.
* Lower the barrier to entry for individuals and organiations who wish to benefit from the outcomes of design work. Design work done at a fair price, with total transparency on what is being paid for.
* Ensure contributors are fairly rewarded for their contributions. Be that financially and/or through copyright and attribution.
* Ensure that copyright is respected, and that appropriate compensation and/or attribution is given to copyright holders. No copyright infringing derivative works made here.
* Allow people to work on what they want, how they want, when they want; Don't make people work on things they either don't want to do for whatever reason they may have, be that morally, politically, etc.
* Contribute to and encourage the development of and encourage the adoption of free and open-source design tools, be it software, techniques and methods, frameworks, etc.

## How it may work
* An organisation works the with us to brief a design problem.
* A contract is drawn up defines what will be done, what it will cost, etc.
  ** Consider the idea that this is a smart contract (think Ethereum DAO) where the client organisation would put up the amount outlined in a crypto-currency and on satisfaction of the contract terms that currency is proportionally disbursed to those who contributed.
* ODA contributors do the work, in public. Everything is posted on publicly accessible platforms, design files/documents/source code/recordings of meetings and calls/chat-logs made available and everything licensed under the GNU General Public License or a similar free/open license.
* That's pretty much it at a high level.

The influence from the free and open source software movement could extend beyond the freedom to use, modify, and distribute ODA works. Privately held design agencies have and require many different business functions: business development, project management, the design team, technology, operations, finance, professional development, legal, marketing, etc, etc, etc. We could look at the structure of free software projects as a model by which we could manage these functions.

Consider the Linux Kernel project. Hundreds of people across the world contribute code to specific areas of the kernel, be it io, graphics, hypervisor, etc. Each of these areas has maintainers and reviewers, who are responsible for assessing the code contributions from the community and deciding if they should be put forward for possible inclusion in official releases. Then at the top of this tree of maintainers the overall project maintainers (Linux Torvalds, Greg K-H, et al.) look at what the area maintainer puts forward and then make final decisions on which contributions are included in the official releases of the software. All this decision making is done in public on mailing lists, furthermore things like code standards are available so contributors know in advance what is expected of them in terms the quality of the code they submit, etc.

Consider that model applied to the functions of a design agency. The ODA could operate that way.
